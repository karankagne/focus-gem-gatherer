Hi, I'm Shivkaran! I leverage AI agents to build applications efficiently and effectively. My approach combines traditional development expertise with cutting-edge AI tools to streamline the development process, reduce boilerplate, and focus on creating value for users.

I believe that the future of development includes AI-assisted workflows that help create better software faster. This project demonstrates how I use modern tools to build cross-platform applications with clean, maintainable code.
